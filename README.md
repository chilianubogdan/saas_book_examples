## Multitenancy with Rails example code

This is the code from Multitenancy with Rails.

I am currently going through it and updating it for the latest Rails and RSpec releases. Each commit to this project is for a feature within the book, and so it should be possible to jump to the end of a commit to see what the code *should* look like according to the book.

If there's any problems or misteaks, please contact me via email: me@ryanbigg.com.

Thanks for reading!
